A series of proof-of-concept tools to automaticaly detect asteroids in satellite imagery from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, as well as human-verify the results, and display collections of verified asteroids.

* `README` -- This README
* `data.csv` -- The breakdown of all possible combinations of run, camcol, and field for the survey (as not all are valid)
* `detect.py` -- Pulls a new image from the DB for a human to verify
* `process.py` -- Processes a new image from the SDSS, and stores it's results in the DB to be verified
* `valid.py` -- A display of all user-validated images, plus some stats.

A demo is available at http://misc.dustingram.com/astro/valid.py
